# Silent Error in Next.js 15 Server Components with Deeply Nested Async/Await

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Next.js 15's server components where errors within deeply nested `async/await` structures might not propagate properly, leading to silent failures.  The `nestedAsyncError.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `nestedAsyncSolution.js` provides a solution using proper error handling techniques.

## Bug Description

When using `async/await` within multiple nested functions in a server component, exceptions thrown deep within the nested structure might not be caught correctly. This results in the server component seemingly working without error, but producing an unexpected or incorrect result without any indication of the failure.

## Solution

The solution involves careful error handling at each level of the nested asynchronous operations using `try...catch` blocks.  This ensures that any error at any point in the nested structure is caught and handled appropriately, preventing silent failures and providing better debugging information.
