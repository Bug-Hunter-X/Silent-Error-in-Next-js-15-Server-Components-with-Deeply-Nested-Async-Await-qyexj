In Next.js 15, an uncommon error arises when using server components with the `async/await` pattern within a deeply nested structure. If an error occurs deep within this structure, the error might not propagate correctly, leading to a silent failure rather than a clear error message.  This is especially problematic since debugging deeply nested asynchronous code can be very challenging.
